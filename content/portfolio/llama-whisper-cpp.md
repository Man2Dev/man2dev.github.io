## Overview

Contributions to two popular C/C++ AI model implementations: Llama.cpp for large language models and Whisper.cpp for speech recognition.

## Llama.cpp

[Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is a high-performance C/C++ implementation for running LLaMA models efficiently on consumer hardware.

### Contributions
- Helped improve build system compatibility
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes and testing

## Whisper.cpp

[Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) is a C/C++ port of OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition model.

### Contributions
- Build system improvements
- Documentation enhancements
- Cross-platform compatibility fixes

## Impact

These projects enable running state-of-the-art AI models locally without requiring expensive GPU hardware or cloud services, democratizing access to AI technology.
